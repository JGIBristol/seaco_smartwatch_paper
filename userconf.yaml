# The location of the SEACO files (i.e. your RDSF mount)
# If you're on Windows and have mounted this on Z:, it will just be "Z:"
# If you're on WSL and have mounted it on Z:, it might be "/mnt/z/"
# If you're on Linux, it will be something else
# Mount with e.g.
# mount -v -t cifs //rdsfcifs.acrc.bris.ac.uk/SEACOCH20 /mnt/z/ -o username=mh19137,workgroup=UOB
# or gio mount if the above doesn't work
# Using gio mount might work better on WSL, but it will create the mount point somewhere
# strange like /run/user/XXXXXXX/gvfs/smb-share:server=rdsfcifs.acrc.bris.ac.uk,share=SEACOCH20/
# So you'll just have to look for it somwhere like that
seaco_dir: "/mnt/z/"
